This is a basic location tracker that uses your GPS to track your location and draw a path for where you have travelled.
It also has the added flexibility of stopping your location tracker whenever you want and also has an additional option that lets the
user share their used path with other users via sharing tools.
This app was created using Java in Android Studio. This was a part of my Mobile App Development Class second assignment.
